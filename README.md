CIS 120 Final Project
====
CIS 120 Final Project - Build A Game. Implementation for 3D Snakes using native
AWT drawing in Java.

![Demo of Game](https://github.com/jabbany/CIS120FinalProject/blob/master/snakes_screenshot.png?raw=true)

Buliding and Playing
----
Compile the game into a jar, and place it within the same directory as `gamedata.dat`.
The game will attempt to find `gamedata.dat` and load level information as well as the 
playing field into the game.



Graphics
----
This game runs on a (rather primitive) 3d rendering engine built from scratch on top of
 basic AWT Graphics methods. It does not rely on hardware 3D so should run on any system.

Design your own Game
----
The game setup is stored in gamedata.dat and contains all the level info as well as the
setup of the playing field. Instructions on how to create your custom map are given as
comments in the sample gamedata file included. Be aware that the game may fail unexpectedly
if illegal game data setup is given.

Inspiration
----
This game was inspired by the classic 3D Snakes game present on Nokia S60v3 phones.
It was also my final project for CIS 120 (Fall, 2012).

Licensing
----
You can use this game, in full or any part in any commercial or non-commercial code. But
you MAY NOT use this within a HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT.
